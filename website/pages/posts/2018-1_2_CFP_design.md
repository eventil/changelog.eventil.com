We've updated the Call for Proposals view by adding to it comments and grades to submissions. This will definitely help the committee in choosing the best options. We have made the CFP view similar to other tabs, which increases the consistency of the event management view.

The changes will have a positive impact on the CFP view by interested parties in the event. Add CFP to your event and increase the number of participants several times!
