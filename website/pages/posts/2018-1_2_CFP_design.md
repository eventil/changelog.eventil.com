Call for Proposals updates! Invite a committee to help you with the process of choosing the best proposals for your event. We added new functionalities: comments and grades. Now you don’t have to browse through proposals on your own. Let the committee members leave a note for you and choose what presentations are better that others.

We've updated the Call for Proposals view by adding to it comments and grades to submissions. This will definitely help the committee in choosing the best options. We have made the CFP view similar to other tabs, which increases the consistency of the event management view.

Call for proposals session mentions the review period for the paper. These papers are peer-reviewed and status of the manuscript is notified to the authors within the specified review period. Also, the “call for papers” provides acceptance of more journals at a single organized platform.

The changes will have a positive impact on the CFP view by interested parties in the event. Add CFP to your event and increase the number of participants several times.
