The latest update concerns the view of the sponsors list both from the event management level and from the event's general view. We have added a possibility to ask for sponsors manually. By e-mail you can report the name of the sponsor and our service department will add them smoothly.


The upgrade concerns the view of the sponsors list both from the event management level and from the event's general view. We have added the possibility to ask for sponsors manually. By e-mail you can report the name of the sponsor to the event and our service department will help you in contact with him.

In the general view of the event, we have enlarged the sponsor's logo so that it will be even more visible. This is the answer to your comments, so as you can see, we don't remain deaf to it.

See how beautiful and transparent it looks now!
